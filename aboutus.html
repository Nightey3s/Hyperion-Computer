              we are obsessed with squeezing every ounce of performance from our computers.
              Anyone can put a system together, however to unlock maximum performance,
              factors such as: the wiring, airflow, power delivery, and layout of components represents the core foundation of a true custom PC.</p>

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p class="moredesc">High-performance hardware needs to be properly tested for bottlenecks and stability issues.
                  Our team of technicians test every custom gaming computer with a series of stress-tests and benchmarks that analyze all the components.
                  Once the gaming PC passes these tests, it goes through a second round of testing to ensure the performance is consistent
                  before sending the computer to our quality assurance team.</p>
