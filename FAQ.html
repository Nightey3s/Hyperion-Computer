            <strong>Q: </strong>
            &emsp;I am having start up, stability, or performance issues

            <p>
              <strong>A: </strong>
              <br>All of our systems are extensively tested in our facility prior to shipment, a defective component is very unlikely. However, when you put shipping into the equation (bumps, drops, vibrations, and shocks), a crucial component might have dislodged loose inside. Reseat all memory, video card, sound card, PCI card drives and verify the 24-Pin motherboard power cable and 4-Pin CPU power cable are secured mounted to the motherboard. You should also try to isolate a bad component, such as a stick of memory, PCI card, or video card and see if that resolves the issue.

            <strong>Q: </strong>
             &emsp;I hear no sound while playing games or listening to music
          </h4>

            <p>
              <strong>A: </strong>
                <br>You should check if your audio output device is connected to the computer. If you have a dedicated sound card, ensure your audio device is plugged into
                it. Otherwise, try plugging it into the motherboard output jack. If the audio device is plugged in and there is still no sound, check if the volume is too low
                or if it's muted. If the above solutions do not work, check if the soundcard drivers are installed correctly. If all else fails, you may want to try a different
                audio device.

              <strong>A: </strong>
                <br>Ensure that the cable connecting to the power supply is fully seated in the slot and the plug is fitted snugly in the power outlet. Also,
                ensure that the switch is on. Ensure the switch on the power supply is switched on as well.

                installed on your drive. Reseat the connections if needed and try to boot-up again.

            <p>
              <strong>A: </strong>
                <br>It takes us about 5 to 15 business days depending on the complexity of the build. We will only commence building after the payment is processed.
                If we encounter any issues with your order during assembly, testing, or quality assurance,
                we will hold back your order to ensure we ship a high-quality product to our customers.
                We do not sacrifice quality over speed, that means, we aren't going to rush your order to meet a 10 day ship time.
                We do not guarantee ship times mainly because we don't want to be stuck with a deadline when we want to make sure our customers receive nothing but the best product possible.
